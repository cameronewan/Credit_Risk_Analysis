# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis was to train and evaluate the data in order to determine credit risk on loans. We did so using machine learning programs to help us evaluate the data. 

## Results:
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier Acuracy: 0.50 Average Precision: 0.99 Average Recall: 0.87
